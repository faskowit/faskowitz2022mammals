Connectome topology of mammalian brains and its relationship to taxonomy and phylogeny
==============================

## Paper abstract 
> Network models of anatomical connections allow for the extraction of
quantitative features describing brain organization, and their comparison
across brains from different species. Such comparisons can inform our
understanding of between-species differences in brain architecture and
can be compared to existing taxonomies and phylogenies. Here we
performed a quantitative comparative analysis using the MaMI database
(Tel Aviv University), a collection of brain networks reconstructed from
ex vivo diffusion MRI spanning 125 species and 12 taxonomic orders or
super-orders. We used a broad range of metrics to measure betweenmammal
distances and compare these estimates to the separation of
species as derived from taxonomy and phylogeny. We found that withintaxonomy
order network distances are significantly closer than betweentaxonomy
network distances, and this relation holds for several measures
of network distance. Furthermore, to estimate the evolutionary divergence
between species, we obtained phylogenetic distances across 10,000
plausible phylogenetic trees. The anatomical network distances were rankcorrelated
with phylogenetic distances 10,000 times, creating a distribution
of coefficients that demonstrate significantly positive correlations between
network and phylogenetic distances. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate
species-level organization across scales and informational sources: we relate
brain networks distances, derived from MRI, with evolutionary distances,
derived from genotyping data.
